**Anything else? (optional)** (e.g. screenshots, additional information, etc.)

## Checklist

- [ ] I checked that it is in alphabetical order.

- [ ] I have provided a clear and concise description of the awesome thing.
- [ ] I have provided a link to the awesome thing.
- [ ] I have assigned the correct category to the awesome thing.

**Please note:** If you are adding a new category, you will need to create a new section in the `README.md` file. Please make sure to update the table of contents as well.

**Important:** The idea of this repository is to bring together free projects for open-source contributions. If the proposed addition is an entirely paid project, the PR will be closed.
